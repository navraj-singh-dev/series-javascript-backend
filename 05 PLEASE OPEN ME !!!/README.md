## Important

- this repository is continued in new independant repository [mega-project-javascript-backend](https://github.com/navraj-singh-dev/mega-project-javascript-backend).
- reason for doing this is:

  - instead of learning backend concepts and not applying them anywhere, [mega-project-javascript-backend](https://github.com/navraj-singh-dev/mega-project-javascript-backend) implements a YOUTUBE inspired, very complex backend.
  - here learning is huge and big project is created and only the industry standard is followed.
  - so making a complex and huge project inside of a repository inside a folder doesnt make sense, as it makes maintaining the project a hectic and a huge mess.
  - thats why instead of continuing this project in [series-javascript-backend](https://github.com/navraj-singh-dev/series-javascript-backend), this project is a independant repository named [mega-project-javascript-backend](https://github.com/navraj-singh-dev/mega-project-javascript-backend)

- so from here please visit [mega-project-javascript-backend](https://github.com/navraj-singh-dev/mega-project-javascript-backend) to be on the right track.
